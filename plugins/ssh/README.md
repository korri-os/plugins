# Optional administrative OpenSSH

`packages.<system>.korri-plugin-ssh` supplies `@korri:ssh`. After one compatible
host update, the existing root CLI installs, enables and disables it without a
NixOS rebuild, system switch, or device-side compilation. It is not published
or enabled by default. Publisher composition builds this source with its own package set.

**Local owner enrollment and approval UI do not exist yet.** This implements
the root CLI path, not that missing consumer. An SSH-disabled image with no
other administrator access still needs a separately approved local owner path.
Do not promise that the image meets the full parked SSH acceptance item yet.

## Authority and coexistence

| Native request | Effect |
|---|---|
| `User=root` | Device-wide authority, named in the approval report. No dynamic-user sandbox. This applies only to the exact approved build, not to other plugins. |
| `Type=notify` | Wait for the pinned OpenSSH daemon's readiness notification. The packaged daemon refuses partial listener binding before it announces readiness. |
| `ExecStartPre` | Generate and synchronize a per-device Ed25519 host key in the host's existing private `StateDirectory`, before listening. Never overwrite an existing identity. |
| Native NixOS `services.openssh.ports = [ 2222 ]` | A deliberate separate TCP listener. Generate the plugin's firewall metadata from this same option. No UDP port and no plugin rule for TCP 22. |
| Native `sshd_config` | Public-key authentication only. Password, keyboard-interactive and empty-password authentication are disabled. Root requires a valid key, even on a device with root console autologin. |

The plugin never writes `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, recovery host keys, or recovery
units. It supplies its own immutable configuration with `-f`, its own persistent
key with `-h`, and its own runtime PID file. It does not include an existing
sshd configuration or authorized-keys command. It preserves upstream account
key paths: `%h/.ssh/authorized_keys` and `/etc/ssh/authorized_keys.d/%u`.
Existing account authorization files remain device-owned. No private host key,
personal public key, password, or new account credential is packaged.

The compatible host supplies the upstream `sshd` privilege-separation account
when NixOS recovery SSH is disabled. It supplies PAM account/session support
only when no upstream or custom `sshd` PAM policy exists, including recovery
SSH with `UsePAM=false`. NixOS base activation supplies the `/var/empty`
privilege-separation chroot; the host-support check verifies that prerequisite.
Existing recovery and custom PAM policies remain unchanged. The plugin
uses that existing PAM policy; account expiry and host login restrictions can
still deny a key. It neither edits accounts nor enrolls keys.

The host opens declared ports only after native readiness. Failed activation,
including boot restoration of an enabled receipt, stops the staged service and
removes its port rules. Cleanup failures are reported alongside the startup
error. The enabled receipt remains available for an explicit repair and retry.

Disable removes the plugin's declared port rules and stops its managed daemon.
Re-enable and boot recovery retain the same host key. `remove` retains data;
`remove --purge` deletes the plugin state and therefore its host identity. A
later installation creates a new identity and clients must verify it again.
A damaged existing key fails activation rather than silently rotating it.
Preparation also refuses symlinks (including dangling links), nonregular or
non-root-owned keys, unsafe key permissions, and a public key with no private
key. Only absent identity entries permit generation. Operator repair is
required for rejected state; preparation does not change it.

`require-complete-listeners.patch` changes the pinned OpenSSH listener loop to
require every configured IPv4 and IPv6 address. Standard OpenSSH can announce
readiness with only one family bound. An occupied port or unavailable requested
address family now fails activation instead. The patch has no new configuration
language. It requires a separately built and published OpenSSH output for each
architecture. Devices still download prebuilt outputs and never compile it.

**Cost:** this is a privileged administrative service, not a confined network
capability. Root sessions can change the whole device. Disable does not undo
those changes or guarantee termination of sessions moved by PAM into separate
systemd scopes. TCP 2222 must be free. Changing to TCP 22 later is a separate
native configuration/publication and recovery-listener cutover, not an
implicit fallback. No physical device or recovery listener was changed here.

## Native sources and upstream extraction

`plugin.ts` only names the plugin and service. `korri-ssh.service`, `sshd_config`,
`prepare.sh`, and `start.sh` own native behavior. `plugin.nix` substitutes
immutable prebuilt program/configuration paths and uses the shared builder.
The host's existing immutable-artifact contract requires files **inside**
store output directories, not bare `writeText` store files.

`upstream.nix` evaluates the pinned NixOS OpenSSH module on the build machine.
It extracts native configuration, account key paths, algorithm defaults,
immutable SFTP/moduli paths, and the listener's firewall metadata. The native
key-only policy precedes module defaults because sshd uses the first value.
The module's password defaults are suppressed, not maintained twice.

The trigger for extraction is the second daemon, not a generic new module
language. `upstream-effects.nix` records the disposition of all 15 contributed
option paths. A new top-level contribution fails the extraction check until
reviewed. The generated report contains actual configuration/unit paths,
privilege-separation account facts, PAM text, root-provisioning effects and
NSS path. Nested option changes still need source review. The report and
upstream boot units are build-side only; they are not in the plugin closure.

| Upstream effect | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Native config and config validation | Extract; validate with prebuilt build-platform `sshd -G -T`. Use immutable package moduli, not existing `/etc/ssh/moduli`. |
| `sshd` user/group; PAM account/session | Preserve through the compatible host prerequisites. Never replace existing recovery PAM. |
| `/etc/ssh` configuration and authorization files | Do not install. Read existing account authorization files only. |
| Root tmpfiles credential provisioning | Do not extract. There is no supplied owner credential and no enrollment consumer. |
| Host key generation | Replace `/etc/ssh` boot keygen with native pre-start generation in `StateDirectory`. Keys are never immutable build outputs. |
| Boot units and socket activation | Do not install. One optional host-managed native service replaces them. `notify-reload` becomes `notify`; the CLI does not expose reload. |
| `KillMode=process` | Retain Korri's existing `control-group` stop policy instead. Root/PAM effects outside that group are not revocable by this policy. |
| NSS command environment | Existing device accounts resolve through the host's NSS/nscd. No build-machine NSS environment is injected. External directory-service accounts are not verified by this slice. |

Grounding inspected: nixpkgs `a6531044f6d0bef691ea18d4d4ce44d0daa6e816`,
`nixos/modules/services/networking/ssh/sshd.nix`, OpenSSH 10.2p1, the existing
plugin-host `NativeUnit`, `StateDirectory`, `RuntimeDirectory`, approval digest,
and firewall port treaty. systemd 258's `exec_context_get_clean_directories`
removes both public and private state paths, so existing inactive purge also
covers root-service state without a new persisted layout.

## Operator commands

Use the owner's already configured publisher binding and the exact prebuilt
output for the device architecture. Inspect all root authority before copying
the digest; installation alone leaves the plugin disabled.

```sh
sudo korri-plugin inspect "$CACHE_URL" "$PACKAGE"
sudo korri-plugin install "$CACHE_URL" "$PACKAGE" "$APPROVAL"
sudo korri-plugin enable @korri:ssh
ssh -p 2222 ACCOUNT@DEVICE
sudo korri-plugin disable @korri:ssh
```

No enrollment command is implied. Existing account keys must already be
owner-managed. Inspect and verify the device's generated host public key via
an existing trusted administrator path before trusting the new listener.

## Verification (build machine only)

```sh
PACKAGE=$(nix build --no-link --print-out-paths .#korri-plugin-ssh)
nix build --no-link .#checks.x86_64-linux.korri-ssh-upstream \
  .#checks.x86_64-linux.korri-ssh-host-support
sudo "$(command -v python3)" plugins/ssh/process-test.py "$PACKAGE"
```

Core owns the Rust `native_ssh` admission tests; run those from the Core
repository with `KORRI_TEST_SSH_PACKAGE` set to this actual package. The
publisher lifecycle VM also injects its freshly built SSH candidate.

The last command requires an existing NixOS `sshd` account/PAM setup on the
build machine. It runs only a temporary loopback daemon on a random high port,
with test-only keys under `/run/korri-ssh-process-*`. It does not edit host
accounts, authorization files, firewall rules, units or configuration. It
checks the actual prebuilt daemon's readiness, key-only root login, PTY,
wrong/no-key rejection, key uniqueness, restart identity, listener stop,
occupied-port failure in each individual address family, and damaged-key refusal.

Verified locally: the above package/admission/process checks and the full
Rust test, clippy and formatter scope. The host-support check evaluates the
actual module with SSH disabled and compares recovery configuration, PAM,
keygen, service policy and firewall options before/after host support. The
existing Tailscale fixture's builder selects the same store output before and
after this change. Test-first repro: bare store-file
artifacts failed actual `package::load` with `store artifact must name a file`;
packaging now uses native directory outputs. A process-test fixture under
`/tmp` failed OpenSSH StrictModes; the fixture now uses root-owned `/run`
without weakening authorization checks.

**The combined VM gate passed on 2026-09-10.** Run it on a build machine,
never on a target device:

```sh
nix build --no-link -L .#checks.x86_64-linux.korri-runtime-plugin-host
```

It covers the initially SSH-disabled host, root and ordinary account keys,
refused approval and keys, enable/disable firewall rules, enabled/disabled
reboot recovery, damaged-key activation and boot-recovery rollback, purge, and coexistence with
the real upstream NixOS recovery daemon. The recovery unit PID, configuration,
PAM file, host keys and system generation remained unchanged. Systemd and
firewall lifecycle passed in that VM. Physical-device acceptance remains an
unrun gate.

The final test script ran for 478.13 seconds. Three earlier attempts exposed
fixture errors, including a successful SSH client consuming the test driver's
next command. The real process regression now checks stdin preservation.
Automated test clients use `ssh -n` plus a 20-second command timeout; interactive
operator commands do not use `-n`. See the plugin-standard status document for
all verification limits and remaining rollout work.
