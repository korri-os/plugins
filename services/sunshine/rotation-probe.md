# Sunshine KMS rotation cost probe (off-device only)

Historical source: ownership moved to the publisher without changing the exact
Core experiment baseline. No current flake output activates this experiment.

`rotation-probe.patch` is deliberately **not** in `approved-patches.nix` or
`package.nix`. It is an experiment, not a fix ready to release. The first signed
batch, `build-932cd7194921`, **must not be selected on the current Mini**. Its
inspected plugins replace the active root-owned receiver with a different root
setup and require the absent `korri-input-seat-receiver.service`. After the controlled trial, the Mini selected the signed upright clockwise
package `/nix/store/frc9rcm8iw3zlcbhc2dlz9709x30sv4m-korri-plugin`.
The original signed package
`/nix/store/fq4ayc50jgf0b3bd85hpw41cg6kx83ig-korri-plugin` remained its
direct rollback, with `korri-sunshine-input-seat-receiver.service`. These are
last verified selections, not current device state. Any replacement must
retain the original producer and permission boundary.

## Controlled moving-scene comparison (2026-09-29)

The owner confirmed that the clockwise signed package streams an upright
picture with working cursor movement. The Mini then streamed Moonlight Desktop
with the same `glmark2-es2-wayland` shading scene on both signed variants:
`--size 800x600 --swap-mode fifo -b shading:duration=30.0:shading=phong`.
The screen stayed awake. Both runs used KMS RAM capture, H.264 V4L2M2M, and
the same 1080×1240 source. The on run used signed plugin
`/nix/store/frc9rcm8iw3zlcbhc2dlz9709x30sv4m-korri-plugin`; the force-off
run used `/nix/store/fxafkf5xgbnsqrf30ljx7pycqhlvg1xf-korri-plugin`. The
original signed selection was restored between variants, and the working on
package was selected again afterward, with the original as direct rollback.
Sunshine, its input-seat receiver, SSH, the external audio drop-in, and H.264
startup were verified after selection; no units were failed.

Each stream supplied six consecutive 300-frame stage summaries during the
30-second scene. Exclude the first complete window as warm-up, then take the
median of the remaining five window p50 values. These values are summaries
of frame-stage measurements, not individual frame samples:

| Stage (ms) | Off p50 | On p50 | On minus off |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Readback plus conditional draw | 4.780 | 5.021 | **+0.241** |
| KMS capture, excluding FPS pacing | 4.947 | 5.239 | **+0.292** |
| Conversion | 8.801 | 9.138 | +0.337 |
| Encode call | 0.305 | 0.332 | +0.026 |

The median capture-window p95 was 5.218 ms off and 5.790 ms on. The
300-frame window p50 ranges were 4.943–4.985 ms off and 5.217–5.362 ms on.
`glmark2` reported 61 app FPS in both runs (frame times 16.655 ms off and
16.665 ms on). Capture-stage budget-overruns were 3/1,500 off and 15/1,500
on; they do **not** count missed delivery deadlines. Do not add the stage
differences to infer end-to-end latency. The output orientation differs, and
Sunshine's encode-call time does not prove hardware completion. This is one
on/off pair, not a repeated or randomized trial; delivered stream FPS, actual
dropped frames, GPU occupancy, power, and thermal delta were not measured.
Logs are saved locally at `/tmp/mini-rotation-comparison-{on,off}.sunshine.log`.

## Green edges after the upright trial (candidate not deployed)

The owner supplied a Moonlight screenshot with green right and bottom edges.
A read-only screenshot check measured about 40 horizontal and 8 vertical
stream pixels of green on the 1240×1080 picture. An earlier actual Mini H.264
sample at `/tmp/rpmini-sunshine-encoded.j3ISfK/1920x1080.h264` decodes as
1920×1088; its final eight rows are green. FFmpeg's reviewed V4L2 buffer
copy writes only the visible NV12 rows and columns into driver-aligned storage.
The encoded H.264 SPS of that sample did not crop the storage padding. These
observations support a missing H.264 visible-frame crop, not a rotation draw
failure. The exact coded dimensions and SPS of the screenshot's stream have
not yet been captured, so the cause of its right edge remains inferred.

The separate `rotation-crop.patch` candidate uses Sunshine's existing SPS
replacement on `h264_v4l2m2m` only. It forces that replacement even when the
encoder's VUI passes validation. For uncropped progressive 4:2:0 SPS records,
it sets right and bottom crop offsets from coded size minus requested visible
size in the SPS's two-pixel units. It leaves other encoders and already cropped
SPS records unchanged. An off-device 1280×1088 test image with green padding
on its last 40 columns and eight rows decoded at 1240×1080 after an SPS crop,
with no green on either visible edge. `rotation-crop-stream-check.py` reports
`RED` for the earlier real Mini sample (1920×1088 versus 1920×1080), and
`GREEN` for both the rewritten sample and the 1240×1080 laboratory stream.
That test verifies the codec mechanism, not the new C++ binary or the Mini
stream. Both publisher architectures built, and the official signing workflow
[36588085951](https://github.com/korri-os/plugins/actions/runs/36588085951)
published `build-7c984304a1f9`. Its ARM path
`/nix/store/2yyq3ibyrs37yszk9j2bj5hkk1blpfsm-korri-plugin` matches the
locally checked output. Signed Mini inspection accepted the exact closure with
approval `f52b45b4c03ed8c898c42ef2b766cc655d62e1164002d64ec388f25b0c4619b1`.
Its authority, receiver, setup, units and ports match the original plugin.
The inspection did not select or start it. The Mini rebooted before inspection,
and its temporary audio setting had disappeared. The later activation attempts
are recorded below; neither reached a Moonlight stream.

## Signed crop trial blocked at encoder startup (2026-09-29)

The owner approved an exact-path trial. After the reboot, Sunshine had been
logging `Gameplay audio server did not become ready` since 15:24 UTC. A first
video-only switch selected the crop candidate but could not start Sunshine; the
scoped recovery returned the upright package with the original as direct
rollback. The owner then approved restoring the earlier runtime-only audio
file, exactly `[Service]\nEnvironment=XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000\n`
(SHA-256 `992e81a1f01803ee4ed9378ebf42113e6e6554e5c1334c9c0f18d0921e15516b`).
Sunshine stayed active for 20 seconds without a restart. This file is lost on
reboot; the runtime-only repair is not a permanent audio fix.

With fresh owner readiness, a second switch selected the signed crop candidate
while parking and then restoring that audio file. Sunshine passed its audio
check but could not initialize `h264_v4l2m2m` on `/dev/video1`: `Could not open
codec [h264_v4l2m2m]: Invalid argument` at 18:31:49 UTC. The encoder probe
never reached `Found H.264 encoder`, so the script restored the upright
package through the signed original. The upright package also failed the same
codec-open check at 18:32:26 UTC, after audio was restored. Its service stayed
active for ten seconds with zero restarts, but **active does not mean it can
stream**. No H.264 success was logged on this boot. The crop code only rewrites
packets after an encoder opens; this trial did not exercise it. The candidate's
effect on either green edge remains unverified. These logs alone cannot show
whether the candidate caused or merely shared the encoder failure.

The selected package is again the signed upright package, with the signed
original as direct rollback. The audio file has the expected hash; Sunshine,
the input receiver, and SSH were active on the last check. The temporary trial
scripts and stage were removed. The owner then approved one reboot to check
encoder readiness. The Mini returned on boot
`804cccad-6f5d-4d8a-9f48-64b763008934` with the same installed system and
signed receipts. Its plugin host was briefly busy at boot; after that cleared,
the exact runtime audio file was restored. Sunshine, receiver, and SSH stayed
active, with zero restarts in the 15-second check. **The upright package still
failed to open `h264_v4l2m2m` on `/dev/video1`** at 18:44:27 UTC with
`Invalid argument`; no H.264 encoder was found. A stable service is not a
stream-ready service. The reboot did not recover encoding. No further package
switch or Moonlight test was run. Do not switch packages again until the
`/dev/video1` initialization failure is understood, and obtain fresh owner
readiness before a visual test.

## Mini trial result and diagnostic change

On 2026-09-28, the compatible signed force-off package was selected with the
original as rollback. Moonlight returned `failed to start desktop error 503`.
Sunshine logged a KMS capture initialization failure, then no working encoder;
its startup saw a `0x0` expected mode against `1080x1240`. The original package
had shown that same transient startup mismatch before recovering, so this is
not proof that the probe caused the 503. The original signed selection was
restored and Moonlight opened, but the picture remained rotated.

The compatible signed rotation-on package then streamed. The owner still saw a
rotated picture. Its 300-frame capture logs repeatedly reported
`rotated=false`, so the rotation pass never ran. The logged unrotated capture
p50 was about 5.1 ms in the observed windows. This is **not** rotation cost:
there is no rotated timing sample, matched force-off stream, controlled moving
scene, delivered-FPS measure or cursor result. The original signed package was
restored again; its receiver, SSH, audio environment and H.264 startup were
verified active. The trial did not write an SD card or firmware.

The signed diagnostic on 2026-09-29 recorded the awake Mini's actual guard
inputs: Wayland output DSI-1 transform 3 (270 degrees), DRM rotation 1
(rotate-0), and a full 1080x1240 capture at offset 0,0. The old guard logged
`expected_90=false`, so the shader did not run. The first diagnostic startup
found the screen powered off and DRM mode 0x0; the original package showed the
same startup failure until the screen was woken. After both trials, the
original package, receiver, audio setting, and H.264 startup were verified.
The signed 270-guard candidate then opened Moonlight on 2026-09-29, but the
owner saw an upside-down picture. Its log reported `rotated=true` in two
300-frame windows: capture p50 5.24045 and 5.26144 ms; readback plus draw
p50 5.04223 and 5.05645 ms. These are real rotated-stage timings, but not a
controlled on/off cost or a valid visual result. An earlier 503 in this trial
occurred after the screen powered off; waking it allowed the stream to open.
The original signed package, H.264, receiver and audio setting were restored.
This revision reverses only the shader direction and cursor mapping, keeping
the observed Wayland 270, DRM and full-frame guard. A newly signed exact
package and separate Mini approval are required before another device test.

The Mini also has an externally managed `90-audio-runtime.conf` in Sunshine's
host-owned systemd drop-in directory. The plugin host's stop path cannot remove
that directory while the extra file remains; the first update stopped Sunshine
and needed a scoped `/run` recovery from the saved original unit and policy.
For the subsequent trials, the audio file was parked only during the host
update/restore, then restored and applied by a service restart. Do not repeat
a plugin update without accounting for this conflict and verifying the audio
setting afterward.

## Scope and provenance

- Sunshine's `wl_output.geometry` callback supplies the Wayland output transform.
  The existing KMS-to-Wayland output match associates it with a DRM CRTC. That
  match is explicitly described as guesswork in `kmsgrab.cpp`.
- Only the KMS **RAM** capture object tries rotation. It selects the GPU pass
  when the matched Wayland output reports `WL_OUTPUT_TRANSFORM_270`, the DRM
  plane reports `DRM_MODE_ROTATE_0`, and the source rectangle is the entire,
  uncropped framebuffer. The output dimensions are swapped. The source texture
  is drawn into one persistent destination texture; the existing single
  GPU-to-CPU readback takes the destination instead of the source.
- A KMS RAM capture with no transform executes the existing readback call.
  The KMS VRAM, Wayland, CUDA, VAAPI, and RKMPP capture classes are not changed.
  The transform-0 path gains no draw, texture allocation, readback, wait, or
  color conversion. The uninstrumented build has no per-frame clocks or logs.
  `SUNSHINE_CAPTURE_ROTATION_FORCE_OFF` keeps the unrotated path available in
  an otherwise identical instrumented build for a controlled comparison.
- The shader now applies a 90-degree clockwise transform to the raw
  framebuffer. A visible hardware cursor follows the same
  source-to-destination mapping after readback. It visits only cursor pixels,
  not the whole frame; the existing blend already does not scale the cursor.
  A mismatched Wayland output mode cannot authorize rotation. The probe logs
  the matched Wayland output name, DRM CRTC/plane, raw size, output size and
  transform at initialization. The Mini's Wayland event and output match are
  observed; cursor appearance and orientation still need a physical check.
  Sway reports 90 while its wl_output geometry reports 270.

At 1240 × 1080 × 4 bytes, the extra destination texture holds **5,356,800
bytes** (about 5.11 MiB). An uncached full-frame GPU read plus write at 60
FPS would move **642,816,000 bytes/s** (about 643 MB/s). This is calculated
traffic, **not measured bandwidth, latency, GPU occupancy, or power**. There is
no second CPU readback or CPU full-frame rotation in this candidate.

## Off-device gates

Run from the worktree on a build machine with the approved source available:

```sh
services/sunshine/rotation-probe-check.py \
  /nix/store/gybylg65i7xxapkabpwy1jgscbb44b0l-source \
  /nix/store/3gjgvw98yp52scnbwdxibdfw9abzk3k3-source
```

The check applies the probe after both the approved base patch set and the
approved RKMPP patch set. It compares the KMS GPU capture class before/after,
checks that the original unrotated readback stays, and checks the asymmetric
3 × 2 clockwise shader and cursor mapping. These are **static** checks, not a GPU or
zero-copy runtime trace. The `--fuzz=0` probe application prevents silent
context relocation in the two reviewed profiles.

Compile the corrected on profile off-device, without changing the approved
package or patch list:

```sh
nix build --impure --file services/sunshine/rotation-probe-build.nix \
  --out-link /tmp/sunshine-rotation-x86-experiment
nix build --impure --file services/sunshine/rotation-probe-build.nix \
  --argstr system aarch64-linux \
  --out-link /tmp/sunshine-rotation-arm-experiment
nix build --impure --file services/sunshine/rotation-probe-plugin.nix \
  --out-link /tmp/sunshine-rotation-plugin-on
services/sunshine/rotation-probe-artifact-check.py \
  /tmp/sunshine-rotation-plugin-on \
  /nix/store/3gjgvw98yp52scnbwdxibdfw9abzk3k3-source
```

The ARM expression selects the `sunshine-korri-v4l2m2m` RKMPP profile from
Core `1a988da5`, the exact producer of the Mini's active signed plugin and
Sunshine binary. `rotation-probe-baseline.nix` pins that producer. It must
not silently follow the current Core plugin, which changed its units, receiver,
input patch and requested authority. The derivation has an experimental name
and version. Its provenance identifies
it as an experiment and records the probe hash, parent profile and force-off
mode. The new batch needs only an on package; the compatible off variant from
the previous signed batch remains available for a separate controlled trial.
It is **not** an approved Sunshine build or a plugin closure. The existing plugin's approval binds its
exact package closure. `rotation-probe-plugin.nix` builds the matching
experimental plugin output for both ARM variants off-device; it does not
publish or sign them. The official plugin publisher requires the same named
outputs on x86_64 and aarch64, so it also builds experimental x86_64 plugin
outputs. The Mini trial uses **only** the ARM outputs. Do not substitute a standalone executable under the
existing plugin unit, even after signing the binary. The plugin host needs a
publisher-bound signature for the **new full closure** and an inspected exact
approval. The earlier on/off batch contains two outputs with the same `@korri:sunshine`
identity, so lookup by release and plugin ID rejects it as ambiguous. Inspect
the exact ARM output path from the new on-only batch; verify its signed
manifest and probe mode before approving an update. The artifact check reads both actual plugin
manifests, the retained receiver and setup paths, package provenance, patch
hash and AArch64 ELF headers. It does not verify a signature,
Mini GL context, or physical timing. The derivation defines
`SUNSHINE_CAPTURE_ROTATION_PROBE` for timing logs.
Each 300 successful KMS RAM frames log p50/p95/p99/max for capture (without FPS
pacing) and for readback plus the conditional draw. Each 300 encoded frames log
p50/p95/max for `session->convert` and the `encode()` call. `encode()` call time
can include packet handling; it does not prove hardware encode completion.
Readback wall time can include an implicit GPU wait and does not isolate GPU
execution. The counter labelled `budget-overruns` compares one stage with the
negotiated frame period; it is **not** a count of missed delivery deadlines.

## Trial gates before any device change

1. Review the patch and guessed monitor correlation. Confirm visible cursor
   rendering, GL output, 90-degree direction, and output dimensions on the
   actual Mini; static pixel mapping alone is not physical proof.
2. Obtain separate approval for a newly admitted exact signed plugin closure
   and a reversible device trial, not an override of the old approved unit. Recheck the
   exact device, active game/stream, pairing, signature checks, plugin owner,
   runtime overrides, old receiver unit and service policy, and rollback.
   Refuse a candidate with changed native authority or a missing host unit. Record the original signed selection and
   approval before each update. Build off-device; never compile on the Mini.
   Leave the current manual trial alone until its owner is ready. Test only
   one variant at a time: stop the stream, restore the original selection
   with `korri-plugin restore`, and verify its receipt and service before
   installing the other variant. The host retains only the current and one
   previous selection, so installing off and on back-to-back would discard
   the direct rollback to the original selection.
3. Compare `FORCE_OFF` with rotation on the **same** moving glmark2 scene,
   resolution, encoder, FPS, cursor state, and warm-up. Record 300-frame timing
   distributions, delivered FPS and actual late/dropped frames, Sunshine CPU
   time, GPU evidence, thermals, and power separately. The Mini has no verified
   GPU-busy counter, and plugged-in battery readings do not establish a power
   delta. The prior moving-scene baseline was 61 app FPS, 16.654 ms **app**
   frame time, and 148.32% of one CPU core for Sunshine, not capture stage
   timings. The IDR warning is a separate acceptance issue.

**Cost of this route:** an extra GPU pass and texture on rotated KMS RAM
captures, plus review and measured trial time. Cursor blending still visits
only visible cursor pixels. Physical cursor behavior, monitor-correlation
uncertainty, and IDR recovery remain open. Do not ship it on that basis.
